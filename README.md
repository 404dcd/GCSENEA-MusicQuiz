# GCSENEA-MusicQuiz
A music quiz flask app, made for my OCR GCSE coursework.

Run using
```bash
export FLASK_APP=quiz
export FLASK_ENV=development
poetry run flask init-db
poetry run flask run
```
In this directory.

I don't recommend using in production, but if you desire to: use https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/deploy/

Will probably chuck it on to a server at some point after more rigorous security testing. I'll update here with a link.
